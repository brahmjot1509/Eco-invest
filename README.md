# Problem Statement -



The Problem Statement was - 
"Developing a Robust Framework for Evaluating and Promoting Sustainable Investment Strategies to Achieve Long-Term Environmental, Social and Economic Returns in an Evolving Global Financial Landscape"

## Idea and Approach -
Our approach for the above problem statement was to develop an application which combines the power of ESG Analytics and Modern NLP techniques.
The term ***ESG*** in **ESG Analytics** stands for ***Environmental, Social and Governance***. These 3 key factors are used to evaluate the sustainability and ethical impact of a company's operations and practises. These factors provide a comprehensive framework for assessing a company's performance beyond just financial metrics. This can be useful for investors to invest in the companies belonging to their desired industry and help them gain long-term profits keeping in consideration the amount of risk they want to take on.

## Features -

The application consists of 3 main features:

1. **Personalized Portfolio Allocation** - This feature utilises the concept of 2 financial models in the backend for assigning a personalised portfolio to an investor based on the ESG Ratings of the companies.

2. **ESG Ratings Viewing Feature** - This feature allows the investor to search for ESG Ratings and some other financial factors about a specific company.

3. **ESG Insight Engine** - This feature uses the pre-trained NLP model ***ESG-BERT*** to derive the ESG ratings and grades from the news articles related to a specific company.
